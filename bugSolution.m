The solution involves using `weak` references to ensure the object still exists before executing the selector.  Here's a modified version of the code:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) id targetObject; // Weak reference
@property (nonatomic, assign) SEL selector;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (instancetype)initWithTargetObject:(id)targetObject selector:(SEL)selector {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        _targetObject = targetObject;
        _selector = selector;
    }
    return self;
}
- (void)performSelectorAfterDelay {
    // Check if the targetObject still exists before executing the selector
    if (self.targetObject) {
      [self.targetObject performSelector:self.selector withObject:nil afterDelay:2.0];
    }
}
@end
```
This approach ensures that the `performSelector` call only happens if the target object is still valid.  The `weak` reference is crucial in preventing a retain cycle and allowing the object to be deallocated properly.
